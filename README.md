# CryptoStock

## Overview

CryptoStock is an application available on the user's browser. This application displays a companies current market share data (in USD) and its value in the selected cryptocurrency.

Upon loading the application CryptoStock presents a table with five of the best-performing companies in the world along with their current price per share, the volume of shares, and their value in cryptocurrency. When the user searches a company via the search bar at the top of the page, the respective information for that company is prepended to the table.

## Future Development

- Allow user searches to be stored locally on their web browser
- Allow users the option to convert company shares into other cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin (Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- User can search by company name in addition to company stock exchange symbol

## Day Planner
 
This project is an application available on the user's browser. It allows for the user to enter and store their tasks for the day. The timeframe is set to typical business hours (9am - 5pm).
 
Displayed at the top of the application is the current day. The user can enter text in a time block and, by clicking the time blocks respective save button, save that task to the local storage on their browser. The time blocks are color-coded: gray for past hours of the day, green for future hours, and red for the current hour.
 
By creating this project I have reinforced my understanding of storing information in local storage. This project has also introduced me to the moment.js library which in turn has required me to practice resourcefulness when learning to use unfamiliar coding methods.
